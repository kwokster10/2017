# 2017 Ruby for Good Projects

### Charter for Compassion (greenfield project)

With the ever increasing amount of hate an intolerence in the world it is wonderful that there are organizations like charter for compassion. Their mission is to spread compassion so that people are treated the way they want to be treated. We'll be building them tools that will enable them to help catalog and spread the word of the amazing projects that they work on.

### Homeless Children's Playtime Project

Almost half of school-age homeless children have emotional problems like anxiety and depression … They also experience four times the rate of developmental delays and double the learning disabilities, and they are twice as likely to be suspended from school or repeat a grade as other poor children. Research has shown that the simple act of playing makes a remarkable difference in  children’s cognitive, physical, and emotional well-being both at home and at school. We'll be helping the playtime project build tools to help facilitate gifts of toys.

### Diaper Bank (greenish-brownfield project)

Each month over 350,000 children as helped by diaper banks, forgoing their parents having to make the difficult choice of choosing between feeding their children and putting diapers on them. There are diaper banks in 44 states and they provide about 4 million diapers a month to needy families. We're going to be taking what we built last year for the Portland Diaper Bank, adding some new features and turning it into a platform that all diaper banks can use!

### Smithsonian Climate Research (brownfield project)

In the current political climate where the party in power seems to be doing everything the can to hide EPA, climate, and other environmental data is it pretty amazing that there are researchers out there still publishing this important information. We'll be updating, upgrading, and adding features to an application they are using to share this data with the world.

### Elizabeth House

It is a depressing statistic that about 20 percent of children and 10 percent of seniors live in poverty and rely on food pantries. The amazing people at the Elizabeth House are helping low income residents in Laurel by operating as both a soup kitchen and as food pantry. We'll be helping the Elizabeth House by building them tools to assist with their scheduling and volunteers.

### Loudoun Computer Science Initative

If we want to get more people interested in computer science one of the best ways to achieve that is by exposing them to it while they are kids. This is what the great people at the Loudoun Computer Science Initative are doing; engaging their communities and kids with computer science. We'll be helping them build an open source version of a closed source tool for high school (and other) coding challenges.
